I am a [Ph.D. candidate](https://www.esalq.usp.br/pg/programas/genetica/en/)  with experience in plant breeding, field experimentation, quantitative genetics,
statistical modeling, phenomics, and genomics. My line of research is connecting genomics, high-throughput
phenotyping, machine learning, and plant growth-promoting bacteria to plant breeding. My goal is to solve
challenges by applying multidisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, I continuously improve myself in
communication, teamwork, and leadership.
