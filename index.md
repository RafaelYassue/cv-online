I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Allogamous Plant Breeding Laboratory](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/alogamas/) at [Universitity of Sao Paulo, Campus "Luiz de Queiroz"](https://www.esalq.usp.br/pg/programas/genetica/en/). Also, I am collaborating with  [Dr. Gota Morotaâ€™s lab](http://morotalab.org/index.html). My research line is to connect genomics, high-throughput phenotyping, machine learning, and plant growth-promoting bacteria to plant breeding.
