I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Allogamous Plant Breeding Laboratory](http://www.genetica.esalq.usp.br/alogamas/) at [University of Sao Paulo, Campus "Luiz de Queiroz"](https://www.esalq.usp.br/pg/programas/genetica/en/). Also, I am collaborating with  [Dr. Gota Morotaâ€™s lab](http://morotalab.org/index.html). My research line is to connect genomics, phenomics, and statistical modeling to plant breeding.
